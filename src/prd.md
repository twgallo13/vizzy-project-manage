**Visual Metaphors**: Clean data visualizations, smooth transitions suggesting AI processing, and collaborative elements that emphasize teamwork.

**Simplicity Spectrum**: Balanced complexity - sophisticated functionality presented through intuitive, uncluttered interfaces.

### Color Strategy
**Color Scheme Type**: Monochromatic with strategic accent colors

**Primary Color**: Deep blue (oklch(0.45 0.12 250)) - Communicates trust, professionalism, and intelligence
**Secondary Colors**: Light blue variations for hierarchy and depth
**Accent Color**: Warm orange (oklch(0.68 0.15 50)) - Used for CTAs and important notifications
**Color Psychology**: Blue establishes trust and reliability essential for data platforms, while orange accents create energy and encourage action
**Color Accessibility**: All color combinations meet WCAG AA contrast ratios (4.5:1 minimum)

**Foreground/Background Pairings**:
- Background (oklch(0.98 0.01 250)) → Foreground (oklch(0.25 0.12 250)) [Contrast: 17.2:1]
- Primary (oklch(0.45 0.12 250)) → Primary-foreground (oklch(1 0 0)) [Contrast: 9.4:1]  
- Card (oklch(1 0 0)) → Card-foreground (oklch(0.25 0.12 250)) [Contrast: 16.8:1]
- Accent (oklch(0.68 0.15 50)) → Accent-foreground (oklch(1 0 0)) [Contrast: 4.9:1]

### Typography System
**Font Pairing Strategy**: Single-family approach with Inter for all text elements, complemented by JetBrains Mono for code/data display

**Typographic Hierarchy**: 
- Headlines: Inter 600 weight, larger scale ratios
- Body text: Inter 400 weight, optimized line height (1.6)
- UI elements: Inter 500 weight for emphasis
- Data/Code: JetBrains Mono for technical content

**Font Personality**: Inter conveys clarity and modernity while maintaining excellent readability across all sizes
**Readability Focus**: Line heights optimized for scanning data, comfortable reading lengths, appropriate size scaling
**Typography Consistency**: Consistent weight and spacing patterns across all UI elements

**Which fonts**: Inter (primary), JetBrains Mono (monospace)
**Legibility Check**: Both fonts tested for clarity at small sizes and high information density scenarios

### Visual Hierarchy & Layout
**Attention Direction**: Clear visual paths guide users from KPIs → detailed charts → action items
**White Space Philosophy**: Generous spacing creates breathing room around dense data visualizations
**Grid System**: 12-column responsive grid with consistent gutters and breakpoints
**Responsive Approach**: Mobile-first design with progressive enhancement for desktop capabilities
**Content Density**: Balanced information display - detailed enough for insights, clean enough for quick scanning

### Animations
**Purposeful Meaning**: Subtle animations indicate AI processing, data loading, and state changes
**Hierarchy of Movement**: Critical actions (AI responses, data updates) receive priority animation treatment
**Contextual Appropriateness**: Professional, subtle motion that enhances rather than distracts from data analysis

### UI Elements & Component Selection
**Component Usage**: 
- Shadcn components for consistency and accessibility
- Cards for data grouping and hierarchy
- Tables for detailed data display
- Dialogs for focused task completion
- Charts (D3.js) for data visualization

**Component Customization**: Tailwind utilities for brand-specific styling while maintaining component functionality
**Component States**: Clear interactive states for all controls, with loading and success indicators
**Icon Selection**: Phosphor icons for their clarity and consistency at small sizes
**Component Hierarchy**: Primary actions emphasized through color and size, secondary actions appropriately subdued

### Visual Consistency Framework
**Design System Approach**: Component-based system with shared design tokens
**Style Guide Elements**: Color, typography, spacing, and interaction patterns documented through code
**Visual Rhythm**: Consistent spacing scale (4px base) and component proportions
**Brand Alignment**: Professional blue palette reinforces trustworthiness essential for data platforms

### Accessibility & Readability  
**Contrast Goal**: WCAG AA compliance achieved across all color combinations with preference for AAA when possible
